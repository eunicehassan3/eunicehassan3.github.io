During Week 2, my group and I mostly spend our time finishing Unity's Create With Code Units, and got to make some pretty cool games in the process. My favorite unit was Unit 3 because in that Unit I was able to add visual and sound effects to my game, which really enhanced the project. Apart from doing the Unity lessons, we also worked on CITI Training focused on how to conduct social and behavioral research ethically.
