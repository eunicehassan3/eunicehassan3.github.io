On Monday of this week, I spent most of the day trying to figure out why LSL4Unity was not working properly on my computer. Unfortunately, LSL4Unity was not meant for Mac users, so it could not work on my computer. I decided to switch to working on the calibration scenes for our game. On Monday and Tuesday, I began working on the blinking and breathing scenes in Unity; however, we were told that we would be focusing solely on the gyroscope controls. On Wednesday, we had the Mid-Summer Symposium and were able to present our ideas. I enjoyed hearing everyoneâ€™s presentations. For the rest of the week, I worked on the calibration scenes for the gyroscope controls.
