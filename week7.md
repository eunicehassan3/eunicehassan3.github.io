On monday of this week, I spent most of the day trying to figure out why LSL4Unity was not working properly on my computer. Unfortunately, LSL4unity was not meant for Mac Users and so it would not be able to work on my computer. I decided to switch to working on the calibration scenes for our game. On Monday and Tuesday, I began working on the blinking and breathing scenes on Unity, however, we were told that we the only thing we are going to be focusing on is the gyroscope controls. On Wednesday, we had the Mid Summer Symposium and were able to present our ideas. I enjoyed hearing everyone's presentation. Then for the rest of the week, I was able to work on the calibration scenes for the gyroscope controls.
