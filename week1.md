During the first week, I learned more about my group project "Mind Mastery", which is reserach focused on using brain activity to control a game. I was also able to learn alot from the python bootcamp I attended such as reading and writing CVS and JSON files, as well as creating and transforming dictionaries in python. Later in the week, I attended a lot workshops, some of which included workshops on the python libraries Pandas and NumPy, a workshop on Machine Learning, and a workshop on Git and Github.
