Week 3 started off with a writing workshop led by Dr. Pandey. During the workshop, we learned about the basic structure of research abstracts and how to critically analyze them. On Tuesday, we had a presentation on the basics of Figma prototyping and were tasked with creating three more Figma pages to prototype. We were also assigned our literature review topics and were tasked with choosing three papers to read and annotate with the intention of presenting at the end of the week. On Wednesday, we worked on our literature reviews and presentations. We also did mini presentations with our cohort to receive feedback that would help us with our presentations on Friday. We then helped assemble robots for the CareBear summer camp in July. On Thursday, we took a field trip to Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. That trip was really eye-opening. It was cool to see some of the latest projects in computer science, and the APL is definitely a place I want to look into in the future. We ended the week by presenting our Figma pages and literature review presentations.
