At the beginning of the week, we focused on making sure that our presentation was ready for the Final Sympsosium. 
We did lots of test-run to make sure we were adequately prepared. We then spent the later end of Monday getting more feedback on our game from the codebear campers. On Tuesday we had our presentation, which went well. We then spent the rest of the week working finish up our research paper.
