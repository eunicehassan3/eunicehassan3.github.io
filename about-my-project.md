# About My Project

## Mind Mastery

Problem: There is a lack of research focusing on exploring ways to build gaming software that integrates 3D gaming and brain-wave activity. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Use a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to access brain waves
  - Convert BCI data into data we can input into our program
  - Develop a 3D game in unity that uses brain activity to process controls. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a fully developed game that can be controlled or heavily influenced by brain wave controls.
