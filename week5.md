This week, our team was split into two smaller teams: one for the BCI Controls and another for the Unity project. I was placed on the Unity team, so this week I mainly worked on making a mockup of our scene in Figma and then greyboxing it in Unity. On Thursday, some high schoolers came to learn a little bit about machine learning and play STEM activities. They got to test out the games, which was fun. Next week, we plan on preparing for the Midway Symposium, scheduled for Wednesday.
