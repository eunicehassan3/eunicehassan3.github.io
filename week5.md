TThis week, our team was split into two smaller teams: one team for the BCI Controls and another team for the Unity project. I was placed on the Unity team, so this week I mainly worked on making a mockup of our scene in Figma, and then greyboxing it in Unity. On thursday of this week, some highschoolers came to learn a little bit about machine learning and play STEM activities, so got to test out the games which was fun. Next week, we plan on preparing for the Midway Symposium that is scheduled for Wednesday next week.
