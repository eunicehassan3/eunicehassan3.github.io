On Monday and Tuesday, we worked on implementing a BCI overlay onto the greybox, and making it responsive on with the gane. After that, we spent the rest of the week, working on some of the other scenes such as the instructions page, title page, and a menu popup. I also worked on improving the calibration scene for the game.
