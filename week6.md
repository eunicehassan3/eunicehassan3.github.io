Week 6 was mainly just us prepping for the Mid-Summer Symposium. We created a powerpoint, and then filmed demo videos explaining all of the things that we have been doing. Unfortunately, the Mid-Summer Symposium was rescheduled due to technical issues. However, we were able to transition back into our seperate entities of our project.
