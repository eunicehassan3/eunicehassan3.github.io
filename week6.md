Week 6 was mainly dedicated to preparing for the Mid-Summer Symposium. We created a PowerPoint and filmed demo videos explaining everything we had been doing. Unfortunately, the Mid-Summer Symposium was rescheduled due to technical issues. However, we were able to transition back into the separate components of our project. I spent the rest of the week working on trying to connect the Muse 2 to Unity.
