Week 4 began with a presentation on AI and education, followed by a writing presentation by Dr. Pandey. Then, we met our high school mentors. On Tuesday, we worked on our project design document and wireframe for the games we are designing, and presented them to our group. On Thursday, we took a trip to NASA, which was pretty interesting. We got to look at their testing center and computer equipment.
